<li><p><b>Current</b>: I am currently a Ph.D. Student in the Department of <a href="https://ieor.columbia.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)</a> at <a href="https://columbia.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Columbia University</a>.

<li><p><b>Work experience:</b> 
Prior to Columbia, I worked as a Data Scientist at McKinsey. I worked on digital solutions across electronic manufacturing firms, financial institutes, and cloud service providers. 
I implemented ML tools to identify components at risk of shortage, utilized simulations to determine optimal inventory levels thereby averting excess or shortages, and assessed the most efficient routing options. In the finance industry, I worked on building modularized tools such
as Know-Your-Customer analysis, recommendation systems, and lifetime value calculation, among others. Prior to McKinsey, I worked as a Research Professional (Pre-doc) at Chicago Booth School of Business.</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Pre-Ph.D. life</b>: Before Chicago Booth, I graduated from <a href="https://lse.ac.uk/economics" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>London School of Economics and Political Science</a> (LSE), with a M.
Sc. in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics</a>. My undergraduate was at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>National Taiwan University</a> (NTU), with double major degree in B. Sc. in Mathematics and B. BA. in Finance.
